# VrayConverter
Converst Cycles to V-ray

Key Features:

Material Conversion: Effortlessly converts Principled BSDF shaders to V-ray materials, maintaining core material properties.

Texture Compatibility: Intelligently translates Cycles textures to their V-ray equivalents for consistent visual results.

Output Node Mapping: Accurately maps the Blender Material Output node to the corresponding V-ray Material Output.

Automatic Texture Connection: Automatically connects textures to the appropriate slots in the V-ray material, simplifying the workflow.

Non-Destructive Workflow: Preserves the original Cycles shader in the node tree using labels, allowing for easy referencing and adjustments.
